# Dog Adventure App Client MVP

Dog Adventure App Client is a front end application that is built using React. The client will be leveraging our back end JSON API to read our models relationship of every dog having many adventures providing us an association of every dog and their respective adventures.

Within the application, it will map full CRUD actions to our back end for the adventures table. The dogs table will have both create and read capabilities.

## Dog Adventure Project Description
Do you have a hard time remembering places where you have created an adventure with your dog? Well with the the Dog Adventure App, you will be able to save your adventures into the app. 

First you would select your dog from the application and then you can look at all the adventures you had with them. From this page you will be able to add more adventures, update adventures or even delete ones.

Got a new dog you would like to take on adventures? You can add them to the app as well.

The Dog Adventure project is broken into two repositories, this one is our front end application.

You can find the back end repo [here](https://github.com/timtran007/phase-3-project-dog-adventures-app-server).
